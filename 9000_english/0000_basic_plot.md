# Teh Plot

## Background:

The action takes place in the alternative universe, where 10% of born kids are special.
At age 7-12 years these kids die of some kind of hemorrhagic fever.
Up to some point in history nobody knew how to heal this decease.
Then some guy in the north found out that stuff from one of the sections of huge northern deer stomach can save these doomed kids.
When these kids are cured, they become 2-3 times stronger, faster and more endurable than average man.
These cured kids often called Annar in the north.
Ordinary people are afraid of them, but they are very useful on the battlefield.
And Annar can't have kids, both men and women.
At the end of their short lives about half of Annar becomes some kind of zombies,
who do almost literally nothing and all they need and want is food.
The other half of Annar goes berserk and becomes utterly agressive towards everything that moves.

Having more Annar than your opponent helps to win military conflicts.

There was a Kalmar Union of three kingdoms: Denmark, Sweden and Norway under the rule of the Denmark King.
The Kalmar Union appeared to answer the aggression of the Hanseatic League,
but when aggressor was defeated, tensions between kingdoms began to rise.

The story mainly revolves around the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg.

The House of Swanberg are second-most powerful house in Sweden which aims to become first.
They have common borders with Norway, which makes it very tempting to improve their position by taking some of Norwegian territories.

House of Abel is less powerful, but its leader Amadeus had shown himself an excellent swordsman and effective commander on the battlefield.


## The Story (Key plot points):

0. A girl called Rose was born in a family of count Amadeus Abel in Norway, when Norway was a part of Kalmar Union. She has an older brother Henrik and an older sister Maria. Some time later her younger brother Bjorn was born.
1. House Swanberg attacks and long-lasting Swanberg-Abel war breaks out.
2. When Rose was 11 it turned out that she is Annar. Because she got that decease and was cured.
3. Rose's parents decide to hide that she is Annar from nobility.
4. Rose herself decides to become a warrior maiden, her father Amadeus supports her decision and hires more Annar to form a special war unit. Among them there is 9-year old albino girl Anna.
5. When Rose turns 15 she gets a crush on Anna and after some time, they fall in love with each other.
6. Rose's sister Maria marries Alexander Jorn of a very rich and powerful House, which is close to the king of Norway. This improves Abel's positions a lot.
7. No one can win the war. Houses proclaim ceasefire, but the peace is shaky. So Rose's parents and Swanbergs decide to arrange a marriage when Karl will come of age.
8. About the age of 17 Rose learns that she has to marry Karl Swanberg, who is 15 at the point, and she's not happy with that.
9. A lot of nobility gather at the castle of Abels, where Rose and Karl's betrothal will be officially announced. Karl is fond of Rose, which leads to his conflict with Anna.
10. At some point Anna breaks into Rose's chambers when Rose and Karl were hanging out and punches Karl in his face. Karl tries to make Anna ask for forgiveness and get away, but it's not an option for Anna, so she beats him to a pulp, Rose barely managed to stop her before Anna killed Karl.
11. When adults ask what happened, Rose covers Anna and takes responsibility for her actions.
12. House Swanberg asks for too big reparations from House Abel, basically making them life-long debtors of House Swanberg. House Abel refuses to pay such debts, thus a war between these two houses breaks out once again.

13. Amadeus asks for help from his king Einar. Einar tried to negotiate with the king of Sweden Bertil and the king of Denmark Valdemar, but was unsuccessful. King Valdemar stays neutral. King Bertil supports Swanbergs. He decided to conquer Norway first and solve internal conflicts later, which means that now it is Sweden-Norway war. And the defeat of Norway is very likely despite the fact that King Einar will help Abels with everything he can.
14. Swedish troops under the banners of Swanbergs start to move towards Abel's castle Audunborg, but they move slower than expected. Rose leads her War Maidens make raides, striking from flanks and rear, often catching her enemies at the time when they can't respond with a proper counter attack.
15. Once Swanbergs manage to create proper ambush for War Maidens, many of them get killed. Rose and Anna are captured and delivered into Swanberg's Vargslott castle.
16. Here, for the disgrace Rose made to the House Swanberg, Karl's father sentence Rose to loose her hands, which is done so. Rose is kept in the dungeon of Vargslott castle as a potential hostage, though Karl's father aims to capture Audunborg soon.
17. In the darkness of the dungeon Rose feels the pain in the amputated hands. After some time she finds out that she can control them and, surprisingly, move things around.
18. Rose breaks out of her cage and finds Anna in rather bad state.
19. Since Rose is frequently visited by Karl (and his behavior is rather controversal), she asks him to let her out, Karl refuses. Rose has no other option but to get together the remaining War Maidens (there are few of them in the dungeon) and break out.
20. In the ferocious fight Rose and Anna manage to leave Vargslott castle (and steal some money for future) and flee to the Sweden capital which is nearby. There they find out that Audunborg has fallen, but in his last stand Amadeus managed to take Karl's father with him and Einar will negotiate with Karl for ceasefire.

21. Rose, Anna and other few remnants of the War Maidens move to the capital of Norway, where they meet with Rose's sister Maria, her husband Alexander and her younger brother Bjorn and later king Einar himself. There's ceasefire, but no truce yet.
22. Rose teaches her 'phantom hands' ability to Anna.
23. Rose demonstrates her abilities before the king and other few chosen (Anna is not included). And convinces them that with her new abilities Norway can turn tides of the war and launch a successful counterattack. She wants to claim Audunborg back. Einar agrees, but now royal forces will not take any action, because he wants to leave the opportunity of truce. Instead, they plan a diversion. Remains of Abel army under Bjorn's command will move towards Audunborg. Rose and her War Maidens will sneak into castle by a secret passage known only to them, suppress any opposition and open the gates for the army. This should be enough to hold Audunborg. If this operation will be successful, Einar will join and they will fight Swanbergs back. Einar also states that it would have been better to have Karl alive because he is useful opposition to the king Bertil.
24. Imprisonment in Vargslott castle took a huge toll on Anna and she becomes a little bit less stable. Anna is also not so happy about the situation where all major decisions are made without her voice.
25. Preparations for the operation are in motion: Rose and Anna teach their techniques to other Annar, forming new battle group. But their relationship has several cracks: first, Anna herself is cracking, second, they alienate a little which may end up in infidelities on behalf of Anna.
26. Sooner or later the last of Abel army under Bjorn's command sets on foot towards the Audunborg castle. Alexander Jorn handed some additional troops to solidify the success, but the army still quite small. They aim to capture Audunborg while Karl's main army sieges another castle. Rose and Anna and other War Maidens at first move with the army.
27. At some point War Maidens split up. Rose, Anna and selected few others move to a secret road, while Bjorn and his army march the main road.
28. Bjorn lays out a siege of Audunborg. Karl learns about it and moves his army to lift the siege.
29. Karl and Rose arrive almost at the same time. Karl engages in battle with Bjorn. Rose and Anna blase through the Audunborg and open the main gates to join the decisive battle.
30. The updated War Maidens turn scales of battle towards the Abel army, but Anna wants Karl dead, Rose follows her, trying to reason but this doesn't work. When Anna finds Karl, she attemts to kill him, but Rose stands in her way and makes Karl flee from the battlefield. This was the last straw for Anna, she can't bear that Rose still defends Karl, completely looses her connection with reality and goes berserk and her first target is Rose. After a long and dramatic fight Rose manages to blow a deadly strike to Anna and shock her back to conscious.
31. In her last moments, Anna asks Rose for forgiveness and wants to die as a War Maiden, not a berserk. With a grave heart Rose fulfills her wishes.
