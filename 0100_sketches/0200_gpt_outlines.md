## Considerations

This sounds like an interesting plot with several conflicts and challenges for the main character, Rose. Here are a few suggestions for further developing the story:

    You might want to consider adding more depth to the characters, especially Rose and Anna. What motivates them and drives them to act in certain ways? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

    The conflict between Rose and Anna over Karl could be developed further to add more tension and drama to the story. Perhaps Karl could be more of a scheming and manipulative character, trying to pit the two women against each other for his own gain.

    The background of the alternative universe, including the history of the Kalmar Union and the significance of the "Others," could be fleshed out more to add depth and context to the story.

    The buildup to the war between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg could be developed more to increase the stakes and tension. What are the motivations of the different parties involved, and how do they try to outmaneuver each other before the conflict breaks out?

I hope these suggestions are helpful! It's always a good idea to take some time to consider and revise your plot before diving into the actual writing process. Good luck with your novel!

It is certainly possible for a marriage to be used as a means of resolving conflicts and tensions between noble houses. In many cases, marriages were arranged for political or strategic reasons, with the goal of strengthening alliances and consolidating power. In your story, the betrothal of Rose and Karl could have been intended as a way of bringing peace between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg.

However, it's important to consider the motivations and desires of the individuals involved in the marriage. If one or both parties are opposed to the arrangement, or if there are other underlying conflicts or grudges between the houses, the marriage may not be sufficient to prevent a break out of hostilities.

It might also be useful to consider the larger political and social context in which the houses are operating. Are there other factions or external forces at play that could influence the situation? How do the various houses and groups within the Kalmar Union relate to each other, and how do they pursue their own interests and agendas? These are all factors that could contribute to the decision to go to war.

####

>> Kalmar Union is a union of three northern kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden under the rule of the Denmark king. The union appeared because the kingdom of Norway was already dependent on Sweden and the queen of Sweden married the king of Denmark.

>> Norway is looking for opportunities to break free from Kalmar union.

>> House Abel is actually young, Amadeus Abel (Rose's father) was just a sell-sword and fought for the king of Norway and had a lot of success, but he wants to get even more and doesn't want to stay at the same level.

>> House of Swanberg is age-old and second-most-powerful house in Sweden after the Swedish Royal family. I guess, that Swanbergs just wanted to conquer all Norway at once, but were stopped by Abels. Unable to win the war, Swanbergs called for peace and tried to arrange a marriage with Abels. Though this is kinda questionable.

Thank you for providing more context on the Kalmar Union and the background of the two noble houses. This information will help to add depth and complexity to the story.

It sounds like the conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg has a long history, with both sides seeking to gain an advantage over the other. The proposed marriage between Rose and Karl could be seen as a way for the House of Swanberg to try and gain a foothold in Norway, while the House of Abel may see the marriage as a way to strengthen their position within the Kalmar Union.

In this scenario, it seems that the marriage alone may not be sufficient to prevent a break out of hostilities, as there are underlying tensions and rivalries between the two houses. The fact that Norway is seeking to break free from the Kalmar Union could also be a factor that contributes to the conflict.

It might be interesting to explore the perspectives and motivations of the different characters within the two houses, and how they navigate the political and social landscape in which they operate. You could also consider the role of external forces and factions, such as the Swedish royal family and other noble houses, in shaping the conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg.


####

>> Well, if Anna beats heir of Swanbergs to a pulp and Rose covers her, it looks like a terrible insult for Swanbergs with a war as the only possible outcome.

Yes, it's possible that the altercation between Anna and Karl could be seen as a significant insult to the House of Swanberg, and could be the catalyst for a full-blown war between the two houses.

However, it's important to consider the broader context in which this event takes place. Are there any preexisting tensions or grudges between the two houses that could contribute to the decision to go to war? How do the other members of the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg react to the altercation, and what role do they play in shaping the outcome?

It might also be useful to consider the potential consequences of going to war. What are the stakes and potential risks for both sides, and how do they weigh these against the potential benefits of victory? How do the broader political and social dynamics of the Kalmar Union, as well as any external forces, influence the decision to go to war?

By considering these and other factors, you can create a more nuanced and believable portrayal of the events leading up to the war between the two houses.

It sounds like the society in your story is heavily influenced by the presence of these special children, and their ability to become powerful soldiers after being cured of the deadly fever. It also seems like there is a significant cost to society in terms of the number of Annar who become zombies or go berserk at the end of their lives. It could be interesting to explore the social and political dynamics that arise as a result of these circumstances, and how different groups within the society may view and treat the Annar differently. Additionally, the limited fertility of the Annar could also be a significant factor in the society, potentially leading to conflicts over reproductive rights or efforts to find alternative means of procreation. There could also be moral or ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of the Annar as soldiers and the impact of their shortened lifespans.

It sounds like the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg are engaged in a power struggle within the Kalmar Union, with the House of Swanberg seeking to expand their territory and increase their influence, while the House of Abel is trying to defend their position and possibly even gain ground. Amadeus's reputation as a skilled swordsman and effective commander could make him a valuable ally for other houses or factions within the union, and his abilities on the battlefield could be crucial in determining the outcome of any conflicts that arise. It could be interesting to explore the political and personal dynamics between the members of these two houses, and how they each seek to achieve their goals and advance their interests within the larger context of the Kalmar Union.

It sounds like the story follows the character of Rose as she navigates the political and personal challenges of being an Annar in a society that views them with fear and mistrust. Rose's decision to become a warrior maiden and her relationship with Anna are significant elements of the story, as they bring additional complications to her role within the House of Abel and her relationship with Karl Swanberg, whom she is betrothed to marry. The conflict between Anna and Karl and the subsequent demands for reparations from the House of Swanberg lead to a new outbreak of war between the two houses, putting additional strain on the fragile peace that had previously been established. It could be interesting to explore the motivations and perspectives of the various characters involved in these events, and how they navigate the complex web of relationships and political maneuvering that shape their lives.

It is not for me to determine whether a story is good or bad, as this is a matter of personal preference. However, the background and events that you have described so far provide a clear foundation for the story and set the stage for further developments. It will be up to you as the author to determine how you want to shape the narrative and characters, and to find creative and engaging ways to tell the story that you envision. It is always helpful to take some time to plan and outline your story before diving into the writing process, as this can help you to better understand the direction you want to take and the elements you want to include. Ultimately, the success of a story depends on how well it engages and resonates with the reader, so it is important to focus on crafting a compelling and well-told tale that captures the imagination.

The events you have described continue to build on the conflicts and tensions that were introduced in the first part of the story, with the outbreak of a new war between Sweden and Norway adding another layer of complexity to the situation. Rose's actions as a leader of the War Maidens and her capture by the House of Swanberg bring new challenges for her and Anna, and the revelation of Rose's ability to control her amputated hands adds a supernatural element to the story. The escape from Vargslott castle and the discovery of the fall of Audunborg provide additional twists and developments that could lead to further conflicts or resolutions in the story. It could be interesting to explore the motivations and personal dynamics of the various characters involved in these events, and how they navigate the challenges and choices they face as they seek to protect their interests and achieve their goals.

>> As a result of the fall of Audunborg, many people who Rose cared for are dead, including her father, her older brother and her mother. Since she took whole responsibility for her starting a new war, she thinks that it's her fault that all these people died.

The fall of Audunborg and the loss of Rose's family members would be a significant and emotionally impactful event for her, and it is understandable that she would feel a sense of responsibility and grief over their deaths. This could shape her motivations and decisions in the aftermath of these events, and could lead to conflicts or challenges within the story as she grapples with her feelings of guilt and loss. It could be interesting to explore how Rose copes with these emotions and how they influence her actions as she continues to navigate the complex and dangerous world of the Kalmar Union. It may also be worth considering how the other characters in the story respond to these events and how they are affected by the loss of Rose's family members.

>> By the way, Annar always meant to be supernatural, but Rose is the first one in history who found out that she can move (and throw) stuff with her absent hands.

It sounds like the discovery of Rose's ability to control her amputated hands is an unusual and unexpected development in the story, and could potentially have significant consequences for her character and her role in the conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg. This ability could give Rose an advantage in combat and other situations, and could also lead to new challenges or complications as she tries to understand and control her powers. It could be interesting to explore how this ability shapes Rose's relationships with other characters, and how it affects her decisions and actions as she navigates the challenges and dangers of the Kalmar Union. Additionally, it could be interesting to consider how the revelation of this ability might impact the larger society and the beliefs and attitudes of other characters towards the Annar and their powers.

>> What do you think medieval people will think of Annar?

It is difficult to predict exactly how medieval people in your alternative universe would view the Annar, as it would depend on the specific societal and cultural context in which they lived. However, it is possible that they might view the Annar with fear or mistrust, given their association with a deadly fever and their unusual powers and abilities. The fact that the Annar are also unable to reproduce could also be a significant factor in how they are perceived and treated by others. Some people might view the Annar as valuable assets, particularly on the battlefield, while others might see them as a threat or a burden on society. It is also possible that there could be some cultural or religious beliefs or superstitions surrounding the Annar, which might influence how they are perceived and treated by others. Ultimately, the attitudes towards the Annar would depend on the specific values and beliefs of the society in which they lived.

>> You also should understand that the cure for Annar decease is quite expensive and not everybody can afford it. Actually, nobles will make it so that only them can use the cure to have more Annar in their command.

It makes sense that the expensive nature of the cure for the Annar fever would be a significant factor in how it is used and who has access to it. It is likely that only those with the means and resources to afford the cure would be able to use it, which could lead to a situation where the Annar are disproportionately represented among the nobility and other wealthy or influential groups. This could create social and economic divisions within society, and might lead to resentment or conflict between those who have access to the cure and those who do not. It could also be a factor in the power dynamics within the Kalmar Union, with those houses that have more Annar at their disposal potentially having an advantage in terms of military strength and political influence. These circumstances could lead to complex and interesting dynamics and conflicts within the story.

>> Annar, especially after Rose's invention are extremely more powerful than the common folk. Therefore I think that wealthy can suppress any resistance of the commoners.

It is possible that the enhanced physical abilities of the Annar, combined with their concentration among the wealthy and influential, could allow them to effectively suppress any resistance or challenges from common people. This could create a situation where common people feel powerless to advocate for their own interests or to challenge the social and economic structures that disadvantage them. However, it is also important to consider that there may be other factors at play that could influence the ability of the wealthy to maintain their power and suppress resistance. For example, common people might be able to find allies or supporters among other groups or individuals who have the resources or influence to challenge the status quo. Additionally, social and political conditions might change over time, potentially creating opportunities for common people to advocate for their own interests or to challenge the power of the wealthy. It is ultimately up to you as the author to determine how these factors play out within the context of your story.

####
It sounds like you have a detailed and complex plot for your story, with a wide range of characters and conflicts. The tension between Rose and Anna, as well as the tension between the different factions and houses, will likely be key elements of the story, and could drive the plot forward as the characters navigate their relationships and the larger political and military landscape. The use of Annar as a key element of the story, with their unique abilities and vulnerabilities, adds an interesting and potentially dramatic element to the plot. Overall, it seems like you have a strong foundation for your story, and with careful planning and attention to character development and conflict, you should be able to craft a compelling and engaging narrative. If you have any further questions or would like additional feedback, feel free to ask.

>> What can you say of King Einar as of the main strategist in the last part of the story? Is he good enough?

It is difficult to evaluate the quality of King Einar's strategic skills without more information about the context of your story and the specific challenges and circumstances he faces. However, based on the information you have provided, it seems that King Einar is a savvy and intelligent strategist who is able to devise a plan that takes advantage of the unique abilities of the Annar and the strengths of the Abel army. By using a diversionary tactic and a secret infiltration by the Annar, King Einar is able to exploit the weaknesses of the Swanberg army and potentially achieve a decisive victory. Additionally, his decision to allow the Abel army to take the lead in the attack on Audunborg, while reserving the royal forces for a potential follow-up attack, shows a willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of his goals. Overall, it seems that King Einar is a capable and effective strategist who is able to develop and execute a well-conceived plan. However, it is important to keep in mind that even the best strategists can face unforeseen challenges and setbacks, and the outcome of any conflict is ultimately dependent on a wide range of factors.

>> What can you say about Rose?

Based on the information you have provided, it seems that Rose is a complex and multifaceted character. As an Annar who was cured of the hemorrhagic fever, she is physically stronger and more durable than the average person, and has the potential to be an effective warrior. However, she also faces a number of challenges and conflicts, both personal and political. Her relationship with Anna is strained, and the two characters have different goals and motivations that could potentially drive them apart. Additionally, Rose is caught in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg, and must navigate the complex dynamics of these rivalries and the larger political landscape of the Kalmar Union. Despite these challenges, Rose is able to demonstrate her strength and determination, and she is willing to take bold actions in pursuit of her goals. Overall, it seems that Rose is a complex and dynamic character who will likely play a central role in your story.

>> Can Rose and Karl be together after Anna's death?

It is difficult to say whether Rose and Karl could be together after Anna's death, as this would depend on a wide range of factors, including their own feelings and desires, as well as the context and circumstances of your story. If Karl still has feelings for Rose and is willing to overlook the fact that she was involved in Anna's death, it is possible that they could find a way to repair their relationship and move forward together. However, the fact that Anna was a close friend and ally of Rose, and that Rose was willing to go to great lengths to protect her, could make it difficult for Karl to forgive and forget. Additionally, the ongoing conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg could present additional challenges to any potential relationship between Rose and Karl, as they would have to navigate the expectations and obligations of their respective houses. Ultimately, whether Rose and Karl could be together after Anna's death would depend on their ability to overcome these challenges and find a way to reconcile their differences.

>> De-Jure Karl becomes the head of the House of Swanberg. After an utter defeat near Audunborg he may wish to end this conflict and look for Rose as the most valuable ally. Actually, throughout the story Rose becomes the most powerful warrior in all Kalmar Union.

It is possible that, after suffering a defeat at the hands of the Abel army and the Annar, Karl might see the value in ending the conflict and seeking an alliance with Rose and the House of Abel. As the most powerful warrior in the Kalmar Union, Rose would likely be seen as a valuable ally, and her support could be key to the success of Karl's goals and ambitions. However, it is important to consider that there may be other factors at play that could complicate or hinder any potential alliance between Rose and Karl. For example, Karl may still harbor resentment towards Rose for her involvement in Anna's death, or he may feel pressure from other members of the House of Swanberg to pursue a more aggressive or hostile course of action. Additionally, Rose may have her own motivations and goals that could influence her decision to ally with Karl, and she may be wary of entering into any partnership with him given the history of conflict between their houses. Ultimately, whether Karl and Rose are able to form an alliance would depend on their ability to overcome these challenges and find common ground.

>> How Karl may still harbor resentment towards Rose for her involvement in Anna's death? I think Rose was never hostile to Karl, Anna was. And Rose actually saved Karl's live on the battlefield.

I apologize if my previous response was unclear or misleading. What I meant to say was that Karl may harbor resentment towards Rose for her involvement in Anna's death because Anna was a close friend and ally of Rose, and Rose was willing to go to great lengths to protect her. While Karl may not have been directly hostile towards Rose, the fact that she was so closely tied to Anna, and that Anna was willing to attack and potentially kill him, could create some tension or resentment between Karl and Rose. Additionally, the fact that Rose was involved in Anna's death, even if it was to protect Karl, could be a source of conflict between them, as Karl may feel that he has a right to hold a grudge or seek revenge for Anna's actions. Ultimately, whether Karl harbors resentment towards Rose for her involvement in Anna's death would depend on his own feelings and motivations, as well as the larger context and circumstances of your story.

>> What can you say about Karl?

Based on the information you have provided, it seems that Karl is a complex and multifaceted character who is caught in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg. As the head of the House of Swanberg, Karl is responsible for leading his house into battle and pursuing its interests, which often puts him at odds with the House of Abel and its leader, Amadeus. Despite this, Karl appears to have feelings for Rose, and is willing to engage in a betrothal with her in an attempt to bring an end to the conflict between their houses. However, Karl's relationship with Rose is complicated by the fact that Anna, a close friend and ally of Rose, is hostile towards him and tries to attack him. Additionally, Karl must navigate the expectations and obligations of his own house, and may feel pressure from other members of the House of Swanberg to pursue a more aggressive or hostile course of action. Overall, it seems that Karl is a complex and dynamic character who will likely play a significant role in your story.

>> You mix up Karl and his father a little bit. At the start of the story Karl is heir to the head of the House of Swanberg. After part two of the story, when Amadeus in his last stand kills Karl's father, Karl becomes the head of the House of Swanberg. Though he's quite young and have to prove himself.

I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that Karl becomes the head of the House of Swanberg after his father's death. As the head of his house, Karl will likely face a number of challenges and responsibilities, including the need to prove himself as a capable leader and strategist, and to navigate the expectations and obligations of his house. In addition to these challenges, Karl will also have to contend with the ongoing conflict with the House of Abel, which may require him to find ways to establish a more stable and lasting peace between their houses. Given Karl's youth and lack of experience, he may struggle to balance these competing demands, and may face resistance or challenges from other members of the House of Swanberg who are more accustomed to following the leadership of his father. Ultimately, Karl's success as the head of his house will depend on his ability to overcome these challenges and emerge as a strong and effective leader.

>> What can he do if someone from Swanbergs pushes him too far?

If someone from the House of Swanberg pushes Karl too far, he may have a number of options for responding. Depending on the specifics of the situation, Karl may choose to try to address the issue through diplomatic or strategic means, such as by negotiating with the person in question or by finding ways to undermine their power or influence. Alternatively, Karl may decide to use more forceful or aggressive measures, such as by challenging the person to a duel or by rallying support from other members of the House of Swanberg to oppose them. Ultimately, the best course of action for Karl will depend on the specifics of the situation, as well as his own goals, values, and resources.

>> Karl have seen War Maidens and Rose in battle. He should understand that he can't win a battle against them. King Einar is also a good strategist, who has a plenty of enormously efficient warriors. At the end of the story Karl is in quite tough situation. Many Swanberg and other in Sweden will wish to continue the war with Norway, though they can't win. King of Sweden will likely be on their side, so Karl will have to go to battle and suffer several utter defeats and disprove himself as a prominent commander, though he is one.

Based on the information you have provided, it seems that Karl is in a difficult position at the end of your story. As you noted, he has seen firsthand the capabilities of the War Maidens and Rose, and may understand that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for his house to win a military conflict against them. Additionally, the fact that King Einar is a skilled strategist with access to a large number of efficient warriors only further complicates matters for Karl. In this situation, Karl may have a number of options for responding, but all of them are likely to be challenging.

One possibility is that Karl could try to negotiate a settlement or peace agreement with King Einar and the House of Abel. This would likely require Karl to make some concessions or sacrifices, but could allow him to avoid the cost and loss of a prolonged and costly war. Alternatively, Karl could try to find ways to undermine or weaken the House of Abel and its allies, such as by rallying support from other houses or seeking allies of his own. However, these options may also be risky and uncertain, and could backfire if they are unsuccessful. Ultimately, the best course of action for Karl will depend on his own goals, values, and resources, as well as the larger context and circumstances of your story.

>> Key point is that from Karl's perspective seeking for peace agreement with Abels and Einar is the only sound option. From perspective of other Swanbergs it's just his weakness.

It is certainly possible that seeking a peace agreement with the House of Abel and King Einar could be seen as a sign of weakness by some members of the House of Swanberg. In a society where strength and power are often seen as important indicators of status and worth, the decision to avoid a military conflict and seek a peaceful resolution could be perceived as a lack of resolve or determination. This could lead to criticism or challenges to Karl's leadership within his own house, as other members may see his decision as a betrayal of their values or interests.

However, it is important to note that seeking a peace agreement is not necessarily a sign of weakness, and can often be a wise and strategic decision. In a situation where Karl has limited resources and faces a formidable opponent, it may be more sensible to try to find a way to end the conflict peacefully rather than risking further loss and damage. By finding a way to negotiate a settlement or peace agreement, Karl may be able to preserve the resources and strength of his house, and avoid the costs and risks of a prolonged and uncertain war. Additionally, finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict may also be in the best interests of the House of Swanberg in the long term, as it could help to establish a more stable and mutually beneficial relationship with the House of Abel and King Einar.

>> Based on given information, what do you think Rose will most likely choose? There's also an option that she'll run far-far-far away from North and its conflicts.

It's difficult to predict with certainty what Rose will choose based on the information provided, as there are many different factors that could influence her decision. However, based on the information you have provided, it seems that Rose might be considering several different options, including the possibility of arranging a marriage with Karl, continuing to fight in the war, or even leaving the North and its conflicts behind.

If Rose is tired of the war and the losses that it has caused, she might be inclined to consider the possibility of arranging a marriage with Karl as a way to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict between the House of Abel and the House of Swanberg. This option could potentially help to end the war and bring about a more stable and prosperous future for her kingdom, but it might also involve significant personal sacrifices, as it's unlikely that Rose and Karl would be able to achieve true happiness together if they do not love each other.

Alternatively, Rose might decide to continue fighting in the war, either out of a sense of duty or a desire to protect her kingdom and her family. This option could potentially allow her to continue to use her skills and abilities as a warrior to protect her kingdom, but it would also likely involve significant risks and personal costs.

Finally, Rose might decide to leave the North and its conflicts behind and start a new life somewhere else. This option could potentially allow her to escape the war and the tensions of the North, but it would also likely involve significant changes and challenges, as she would be leaving her home, her family, and her kingdom behind.

Ultimately, the best course of action for Rose will depend on her own desires, goals, and circumstances, as well as the specific risks and rewards of each potential option.

>> What can you say about Anna?

Anna is a character in your story who has been described as an albino girl who becomes a member of the War Maidens, a special war unit formed by Rose. It seems that Anna has a close relationship with Rose, as she falls in love with her and the two of them are described as being romantically involved. However, Anna also seems to be a complex and possibly unstable character, as she is described as becoming "a little bit less stable" after being imprisoned in the Vargslott castle and suffering significant trauma. Additionally, Anna is depicted as being highly aggressive and prone to violence, as she is described as attacking Karl and going berserk during the final battle. Overall, it seems that Anna is a complex and multifaceted character who is driven by a range of emotions and motivations, including love, loyalty, and a desire for revenge.

>> Going berserk rampage in the final battle is part of her Annar nature. All Annar are prone to that, including Rose.

It's possible that the tendency of Annar to go berserk during battle is a result of their unique physiology and the effects of the fever that they suffer from as children. It's possible that the fever or the treatment that they receive to cure it could have long-lasting effects on their physical and mental health, including an increased tendency towards aggression and a reduced ability to control their actions. However, it's also possible that the tendency of Annar to go berserk during battle is influenced by a range of other factors, such as their training, their experiences, and their personal characteristics. Ultimately, the specific causes of the berserk behavior of Annar are not fully understood, and more information would be needed to understand the underlying factors that contribute to this behavior.

>> This implies that when Rose was born the social institute of Annar warriors was quite well established.
